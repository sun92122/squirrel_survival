You could head for the nearby sycamore
to look for seeds under the snow.

Or you could leap from tree to tree toward
the pine woods and feast on pine cones.
Winter days are short, so you better get moving.

Stripping the bark off trees is one of your passions-
the sweet sap underneath is delicious.
Have you had enough?
Why not try the tender bark at the top of the tree?
Ahead of you, the pine woods begin.
You can see the cones,
ripe amd waiting to be eaten.
Why not have some?
For something quite different,
try the acorns down the hill to your right.

You pause to listen and sniff the wind, but all is calm. 
The smell is really delicious.

You could look for food by the edge of the lake
